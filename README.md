### Description
It's the draft for an app (desktop, tablet and phone) that holds crisis information for citizens in Denmark.
In the case of an emergency such as war, where the electric grid is shut down, citizens would no longer be able to access the internet for information.
As a solution for that, this app ensures they have the most essential information already downloaded locally on device. That includes:
- Supplies checklist
- Survival tips
- First aid tips
- Important emergency phone numbers
- Radio frequenciens for official emergency announcement for all areas of Danmark

### Tech stack
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS

### Disclamer
